# jqDock

---

jqDock is a jQuery plugin that transforms images into a Mac-like Dock menu, with icons that expand on rollover.

The plugin works with images, or images within anchors, and has a number of configuration options which provide :

- Horizontal or vertical alignment
- Image expansion out from an edge or a mid-point
- Positioned labels
- Different small and large images
- Menu fade-in
- Size and sensitivity adjustment
- Initial expansion and instant ‘freezing’
- Inactivity timeouts and ‘wake up’ calls

There are also a number of callback hooks and custom events that can be used to control how the Dock operates, and create some interesting effects.

[Full documentation](http://www.wizzud.com/jqdock/) is available.
 There is also a configurable [demonstrator](http://www.wizzud.com/jqdock/demonstrator/),
 and more than 50 [examples](http://www.wizzud.com/jqdock/examples/) available to help you get started.
